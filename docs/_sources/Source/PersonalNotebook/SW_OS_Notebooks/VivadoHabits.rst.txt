Xilinx is one of my favorite companies in the world. The engineers in Xilinx simply know how to do things right. FPGA is so useful when you want to build a prototype of your system. Also, ZYNQ architecture from Xilinx starts a revolution for all system designers. Hardware and software co-design is never so close to everybody. HLS tools are amazing for accelerate the design iterations. Vivado makes it much easier to put ip-cores together as a system. XSDK is eclipse based, Xilinx makes it so easy to use on all major platforms (windows and linux).

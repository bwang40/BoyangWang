Anaconda is a cross-platform python environment setup tool. It is very useful when managing the python environment in my computers. It has the following advantages:
    * It is easy to install on all platform
    * It comes with lots of useful Python packages so I don't have to go through the environment setup every time. Even if you think Anaconda is too heavy to install on certain embedded platform. You can always install miniconda. Minicoda is a lite version of Anaconda.
    * Package managing is  very easy, it works with conda, pip without any problem

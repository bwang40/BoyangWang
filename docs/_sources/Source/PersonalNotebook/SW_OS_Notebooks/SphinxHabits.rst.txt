Sphinx is a open-source Python based documentation tool. It is make for creating documentations for python libraries. But I found It is very useful when creating my personal notebook online. In this notebook, I can keep record of the projects I have done and some useful information that I ll need when my computer is not available. It is also good for keep track of things. It is so easy to manage so that I ll try to keep update my Sphinx Project. This project will be pushed to my github privately. I ll also consider publishing the html content to the website to make it even easier for me to get access to.

On Windows
=======================
On windows, the anaconda environment is better to be installed with Anaconda. Sphinx comes with Anaconda. However, I have to be careful when dealing with the terminal. Sphinx only available in Anaconda terminal. Since it is not installed system wide. **Sphinx will not be available in CMD terminal of Windows**


On Ubuntu
=======================
Preferred to work with Anaconda for using Sphinx, it is a much cleaner environment to work with. **Anaconda is preferred for easy management**

Third Party software
=======================
These software have to be installed after a clean install of sphinx. Run the following command in Anaconda Terminal
::
    
    pip install sphinxcontrib-bibtex
    pip install sphinx_rtd_theme
    conda install -c conda-forge nbsphinx

Mind Map of Mine
******************************
Why mind map? Simply because my thoughts are not clear enough. Miscellaneous ideas comes to my mind all the time that distract me from things important. That happened all the time. Also it helps me to be more aware of what I have, what I need, and directions to go. These are the ultimate questions that will never have a true answer. But it will get me closer. 

The software I use is **Mind Maps Pro**. Simply because it is free and support pen marking on surface book.

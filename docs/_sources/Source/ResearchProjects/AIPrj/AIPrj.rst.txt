Artificial Intelligence Related Projects
***************************************************
Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, DeepLearning, etc, these are all indicating one same topic, which are approaches of ``teaching`` machines to be smarter. As the mathematic theories, modern computer architectures and computer algorithms improving so rapidly nowadays, it is unavoidable to go to the era of Artificial Intelligence. I don't think Artificial Intelligence developed these days are even close to real intelligence of human beings. However, in the near future within 100 years, we may be able to embrace machine intelligence. Before that happens, lets first get to know what is out there currently for AI. This page indexes the machine learning related projects I have participated. I ll refer Artificial intelligence as :guilabel:`machine learning` across my site since I think it is more nature to call it this way.

My interpretation of Supervised Machine Learning
=========================================================
Regardless of any fancy talking about artificial intelligence, machine learning is simply an algorithm that runs on our computer. It is a statistical processing algorithm that will iteratively adapts its own coefficients while running using the ground truth data and the error of each iteration. to be written...

Hardware Acceleration of Machine Learning algorithms
=========================================================
Machine Learning is hungry for computation power. During the training process, you will need tremendous amount of computational source to reduce the running time of your training. After the training, you will need to deploy your trained model on a platform that can do the forward propagation in real time. Computation power is also crucial during the deployment of the trained network. There are many solutions for this:

    -   Multi-Thread on CPU 
    -   Heterogeneous Computation platform
    
        -   Hardware Acceleration on FPGA
        -   GPU-CPU architectures
        -   ASIC-CPU architectures
    -   Dedicated computational devices


.. admonition:: My entry ticket to Machine Learning

   I get to know machine learning in a project my professor assigned me to characterize a ultrasonic target echo from an almost 0 dB SNR signal. I am so lucky that I choose to study my first `machine learning course`_ on Coursera_ with `Professor Andrew Ng`_. The way he explain the machine learning impressed me and lead me to the gate of the Machine Learning.

My baby steps of Machine Learning

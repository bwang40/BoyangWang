..  This file contains a small project I have done to control the GRBL system on Arduino.
    All the libraries I found online are to control the CNC machine for engraving or laser cutter
    I need to control the Ultrasonic NDT system to scan the object in real time.
    So the control code cannot be buffered, I need to move the transducers with blocking mechanism. 
    The code is written in Jupyter Notebook and interfaced with Ipywidgets.

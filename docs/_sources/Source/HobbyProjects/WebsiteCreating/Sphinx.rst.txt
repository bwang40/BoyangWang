Sphinx Notebook of Mine
*****************************************
`This Site`_ itself is written in `Sphinx`_. It is a python documentation generation tool. However, I found it very powerful on managing the documentation tree, especially when the project kept growing. Unlike WordPress, you don't have to go through a long latency GUI interface to add one more page to your website. Also, changing the theme won't affect the layout that much in sphinx. I hosted this site at BlueHost under the domain name of `https://notebookofmine.com/`_.

As the domain name pointed out, this site is notebook of mine. It contains my notebooks and documentations so that I can easily access them when I need. Also, it keeps records of the projects I have done or participated from 2013 till now.  This site is mainly written and posted for the purpose of recording my activities and clearing my mind. Also, my resume is posted on this site as an advertisement for myself.


Some Issue I found with Sphinx
=====================================
Sometimes, the Sphinx tool will stop compiling your code into html. I still haven't figure out why that is happening. However, run **make clean** will solve this problem easily.
